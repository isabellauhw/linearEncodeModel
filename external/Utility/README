List of functions available for behaviour data analysis ( Alphabetic order): 

generateLickRater_rig.py : This function only uses paqI/O file to plot 1) the licking raster 
        for all rewarded trials & 2) the average lick density. Not rewarded trials cannot
        be plotted based on paq file only - use 'generateLickRatersTwoStim_rig.py' (which is slower)  
        Please change the Lines 170 - 180 based on your paq file. 

generateLickRatersMoreStimTypes_rig.py : This function only uses paqI/O for licking & timestamp from RigBox.
        To plot licks for all rewarded trials based on paq file - use 'generateLickRatersTwoStim_rig.py'   

	This code uses matlab in python. That's why matlab should be compatible with 
	python 3.9 and has the libraries in the code (with all the other codes cloned in this repo,
	including spikes,Rigbox, LakLabCode) 


	###Python requirements:
	Please create an enviroment called decision-making-ev with python3.9 & install below libraries in line 14-22:

	Matlab engine  follow the steps in the link below, pip install matlab is NOT working, pip matlab is a fake library)
